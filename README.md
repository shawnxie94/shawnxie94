# Hi there, I'm Shawn Xie! 👋

## About Me
👨‍💻 Hello! I'm a **backend developer** with a deep-rooted passion for manifesting personal value through technology. With a knack for deconstructing complex problems into actionable steps, I thrive on the sense of accomplishment that comes with task completion.

🚀 My professional journey has been marked by significant stints at leading internet companies like Meituan and JD.com, where I've honed my skills in designing and implementing intricate business projects. My experience with large-scale internet projects has not only sharpened my technical acumen but also enriched my understanding of the multifaceted nature of web services.

🔍 Currently, I'm delving into the realm of **code visualization**. My aim is to transform code observability in certain aspects by employing graphical tools such as architecture diagrams, dependency graphs, distributed tracing, class diagrams, flame graphs, and CallGraphs. The goal is to aid developers in **comprehending and governing codebases**, and potentially, to **automate code refactoring**.

🌐 I believe in the power of visualization to elucidate the unseen and untangle the complex, making the developer's life easier and more productive. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities that lie in the intersection of coding and visual representation.
